Assign the same SELinux contexts used by the home directories to the /xfs directory permanently.

# yum install -y setroubleshoot-server
# semanage fcontext -a -t user_home_dir_t “/xfs(/.*)?”
# restorecon -R /xfs


Create two users: john with uid/gid equal to 2000, password 12345678 and davis with uid/gid equal to 3000,
password 87654321. Make davis‘ account validity stopping in one month.

# useradd -u 2000 john
# passwd john
New password: 12345678
# useradd -u 3000 davis
# passwd davis
New password: 87654321
# date -d “+1month”
# usermod -e YYYY-MM-DD davis
or # chage -E YYYY-MM-DD davis
# chage -l davis

Allow davis (and only davis) to get full access to john‘s home directory.

# setfacl -R -m u:davis:rwx /home/john

Create a directory named /common. Allow john and davis to share documents in the /common directory using a 
group called team. Both of them can read, write and remove documents from the other 
in this directory but any user not member of the group can’t.

# mkdir /common
# groupadd -g 50000 team
# chgrp team /common
# chmod 2770 /common
# usermod -aG team john
# usermod -aG team davis


Create a xfs file system on a new logical volume of 100MB called lv_xfs. Mount it permanently with uuid under /xfs.

# lvcreate –size 100M –name lv_xfs /dev/vg
# mkfs.xfs /dev/vg/lv_xfs
# mkdir /xfs
# blkid | grep lv_xfs >> /etc/fstab
# vi /etc/fstab
UUID=… /xfs xfs defaults 1 2
# mount -a

Write a Bash script called prog.sh in the /root directory that creates 40 files of 2MB each with the fallocate command in the
mounted /xfs directory. Each file has got a name as follows: .file_N where N is a number from 1 to 40.

cd /root
vi prog.sh
#!/bin/bash

cd /xfs
N=40
while [ “$N” -gt 0 ]
do
fallocate -l 2M .file_$N
N=`expr $N – 1`
done
——————–
# chmod u+x prog.sh
# ./prog.sh


Create an ext4 file system on a new logical volume of 100MB called lv_ext4. Mount it permanently
under the /ext4 directory. Copy the files previously created into this new space.

# lvcreate –size 100M –name lv_ext4 /dev/vg
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg/lv_ext4
# mkdir /ext4
# vi /etc/fstab
/dev/vg/lv_ext4 /ext4 ext4 defaults 1 2
# cp -p /xfs/.f* /ext4


Configure a virtual console
# grubby –update-kernel=ALL –args=”console=ttyS0″

Create a logical volume of 200MB called lv_swap2 and add it permanently to the current swap space.

# lvcreate –size 200M –name lv_swap2 /dev/vg
# mkswap /dev/vg/lv_swap2
# swapon /dev/vg/lv_swap2
vi /etc/fstab
/dev/vg/lv_swap2 swap swap defaults 0 0


Create a cron job running as root, starting at 11PM every day and writing a 
report on daily system resource consumption in the /var/log/consumption.log file.
# crontab -e
00 23 * * * /usr/bin/sar -A > /var/log/consumption.log

Set the default target to boot into X Window level (previously level 5).
systemctl set-default graphical.target

Change the hostname to mycentos.example.com
hostnamectl set-hostname mycentos.example.com
