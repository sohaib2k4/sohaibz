1) Swap space can be created out of GPT, MBR and LVM based partitions/volumes.

Correct
Correct answer

True

2) Which file system is best used with LVM volumes?

Correct
Correct answer

XFS

3) What are two ways to find information about swap devices enabled on the system?

Correct
Correct answer

swapon -s, cat /proc/swaps

4) Which tool(s) would you use to mange GPT based partitions?

Correct
Correct answer

gdisk, parted

5) The file system needs to be created on the device only after the Logical Volume is created (lvcreate).

Correct
Correct answer

True

6) You're in the middle of the Red Hat certification test and forget which LVM commands you need to use in order to perform the specified tasks. What option(s) do you have?

Correct
Correct answer

man lvm, info lvm

7) Select the correct order of tasks for creating an LVM for the first time.

Correct
Correct answer

Create the physical volume (pvcreate); Create the volume group (vgcreate); Create the logical volume (lvcreate)

8) How many primary partitions can a GPT partition table have?

Correct
Correct answer

128

9) After adding 50GB more of physical storage to your existing volume group, you need to extend your /dev/battlestar/galactica volume group to include an additional 20GB of storage. How might you accomplish this task?

Correct
Correct answer

lvextend -L +20G /dev/battlestar/galactica

10) What is the maximum disk size for a GPT based partition?

Correct
Correct answer

8ZiB

11) You are extending a logical volume. In order to do this, you have to add the /dev/xvdj device to the volume group "battlestar". What command would you issue in order to accomplish this task?

Correct
Correct answer

vgextend battlestar /dev/xvdj

12) Which file on the operating system contains information about partitions the OS is reading?

Correct
Correct answer

/proc/partitions

13) After making partition changes, the partition changes do not appear in the /proc/partitions. How can you force the kernel to reload the partition tables?

Correct
Correct answer

issue the partprobe command

14) You've just increased the size of the /dev/battlestar/galactica LVM volume. This volume is mounted in /mnt/mydir; what commands would you issue in order for the operating system and files system to recognize the increase in size on the device?

Correct
Correct answer

xfs_growfs /mnt/mydir

15) Which command displays information about a swap device?

Correct
Correct answer

swapon -s

16) What command(s) is used to inform the OS of partition table changes?

Correct
Correct answer

partprobe

17) For an MBR partition, what is the max disk size a partition can be?

Correct
Correct answer

2TiB

18) Which command is used to assign a swap signature to a device?

Correct
Correct answer

mkswap

19) Given the volume group "battlestar" and a physical volume in the volume group "/dev/xvdf1", which command would accurately create a 19G logical volume out of /dev/xvdf1 with a volume name of "galactica"?

Correct
Correct answer

lvcreate -n galactica -L 19G battlestar

20) What is the limit for primary partitions when using the MBR partition type?

Correct
Correct answer

4
