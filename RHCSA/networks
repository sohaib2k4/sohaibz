1. View the current hostname.

[root@anthony1 ~]# hostname

2. Set temporary hostname in the shell to "myserver.domain.com".

[root@anthony1 ~]# hostname myserver.domain.com; exec bash

3. For the "System eth0" connection, add the following DNS for the resolv.conf file 8.8.8.8. 
Ensure the changes are persistent after a reboot.

[root@anthony1 ~]# nmcli con mod "System eth0" +ipv4.dns 8.8.8.8

4. Modify your hostname to ensure it is a permanent change on the system (persistent and will survive reboots).

Note: You can edit the /etc/hostname file or perform the following command.

[root@anthony1 ~]# hostnamectl set-hostname myserver.domain.com

5. Add a file based host entry so the domain linuxacademy.com points to 10.0.0.1

[root@anthony1 ~]# echo "10.0.0.1 linuxacademy.com" >> /etc/hosts

[root@anthony1 ~]# getent hosts linuxacademy.com

10.0.0.1        linuxacademy.com

6. Open the correct file that determines the lookup order of DNS (file based vs external).

[root@anthony1 ~]# vim /etc/nsswitch.conf

7. View TCP ports on the system that are listening for connections and view ports that have established connections. 

[root@anthony1 ~]# ss -tan
